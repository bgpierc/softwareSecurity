In order to integrate GDB with Python, I used a python library called
gdb (import gdb). To run a command, you call gdb.execute("your_command")
in your program. The drawback of using this library is that you have to use a 
workaround: wrapping the python in a bash script. The bash script usage is as
follows-

bash wrapper.sh YOUR_PYTHON_SCRIPT.py

Basically, this script launches a GDB enviroment configured for Python.
